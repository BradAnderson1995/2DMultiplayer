UI
	Add player cards to levels

Menu Controllers
	Implement maybe character select w/ recolored character

Input Controllers (Do this one soonish)
	Separate XBox controllers into separate input manager that uses xInput only
	This will remove bugs resulting from mismatched controllers

Player Controller	
	Set up system for managing internal and external velocities
	Push opponents should work after this
	
Animations, animations, animations!
