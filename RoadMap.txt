Character Controller
	Characters should have several distinct states
		States do not hold any state themselves except for information needed for a single frame
		States communicate with player controller telling it what to do, but do not operate on player controller themselves
		Many states may share the same state behaviour, often transitioning into states with the same script attached.
Design Patterns
	Maintain a functional programming approach
		Code should not be handled in large constructs
		Repeatable code should be handled in separate functions and called when needed
		Use Linq whenever possible
