Menu Controllers
	Implement maybe character select w/ recolored character

Input Controllers (Do this one soonish)
	Separate XBox controllers into separate input manager that uses xInput only
	This will remove bugs resulting from mismatched controllers

Player Controller	
	Possible to escape attack animations by using recovery
	Noticed pressing left and secondary and doing a right secondary once. Could not duplicate.:w
	Observed sprite becoming moved to the up and to the left from the rigidbody

Make force triggers able to launch opposite direction of contact
Shaders


Animations, animations, animations!
