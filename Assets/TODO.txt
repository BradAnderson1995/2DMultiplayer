Menu Controllers
	Implement maybe character select w/ recolored character
		Need a way to pass pressing character in to OnClick()

Player Controller	
	Noticed pressing left and secondary and doing a right secondary once. Could not duplicate.:w
	Held state
	Sprite moved in edge grab permanently (should be fixed)
	Bigger hitboxes
	Pressed left and did right smash
	Air dodge
	Players sliding at constant rate with no input, imaginary force pushing to side in idle

Make force triggers able to launch opposite direction of contact
Shaders

Animations, animations, animations!

AI
	Ghost AI
		Situational State info
			Each player state ID
			Each player position (truncate to integer deltas between player and other players, perhaps nearest player?)
			Player facing right
			Each player shield strength
			All projectile positions/velocities(?)
			Stage information
				If not over ground, fall back to hardcoded AI, stop recording

			6 bits: StateID (truncate first 2 bits)
			1 bit: Nearest to left or right (use closest x or closest y based on ratio)
			4 bits: Nearest X delta range (less precise as player is farther away) 
			1 bit: Nearest above or below
			2 bits: Nearest Y delta range (split up into 4 ranges)
			4 bits: Nearest opponent StateID (simplified based on heuristic state)
			1 bit: Projectile within certain range
			3/4 bits: Nearest opponent shield strength, split into ranges
			(4 bits?): Possibly bits for damage or knockback opponent receives in frame
			1 bit: Player facing direction
			1 bit: Touching edge

		Response info
			0-7: ButtonPresses (A, B, X, Y, L1, R1, L2, R2)
			8-15: ButtonPresses (A, B, X, Y, L1, R1, L2, R2)
			16-19: Horizontal analog (2, 1, -1, -2)
			20-23: Vertical analog (2, 1, -2, -2)

	Hardcoded AI
		Fall back to this if no state found in Ghost AI
		Fall back to this when not over stage (when stage information needed)
