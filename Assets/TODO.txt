UI
	Add player cards to levels

Menu Controllers
	Fix deactivation
		When controllers are deactivated, remove from controller array and move following controllers up in the list
		Move selections to new positions
	Implement level select (maybe character select w/ recolored character?)
	Maintain player settings across matches

Input Controllers (Do this one soonish)
	Separate XBox controllers into separate input manager that uses xInput only
	This will remove bugs resulting from mismatched controllers

Player Controller	
	Be able to jump through the floor and fall through it
	If bored, perhaps implement *VERY* basic AI
		Turned on for players marked COMPUTER
		Probably should just walk back and forth, maybe turn around when reaches a ledge?

Animations, animations, animations!
