UI
	Add player cards to levels

Menu Controllers
	Implement maybe character select w/ recolored character

Input Controllers (Do this one soonish)
	Separate XBox controllers into separate input manager that uses xInput only
	This will remove bugs resulting from mismatched controllers

Player Controller	
	Be able to jump through the floor and fall through it
		OnTriggerEnter2D with box below platform, if player velocity upward, disable collisions, otherwise enable them
		For downward check if colliding on button press, disable collisions, on collision enter for lower platform top box, reenable collisions
	
Animations, animations, animations!
