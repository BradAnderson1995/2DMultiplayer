While recording:
	Build active response state
	Push active response state
		If first frame of sequence, control state must be non-empty (only starts sequence on control press)
		Subsequent presses in sequence must be different than previous
		Pushes state of controller and frame to active set
		Reset active response state
	Punishment/reward calculations update
Push active set 
	Don't push if:
		Set has less than two controller states to it
		Effectiveness is less than 1
	Push active set to existing sequence if or new sequence
		Adds version of sequence to sequence if not seen before or increases frequency of previous version
		Sorts versions based on frequency encountered
		Increment sequence effectiveness by reward, decrement by punishment
	Reset active set
